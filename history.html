        <p>Taking a closer look at the history of those associations and where they originate can provide us with a different perspective on black cats. Our ability to create more positive and logical opinions on black cats can be expanded by separating ourselves from the stories and myths of the past and attempting to move forward. </p>

        <h2>ANCIENT EGYPT</h2>
        <p>In ancient Egypt, cats were considered divine symbols, demi-deities, with symbols and carvings of them everywhere around ancient Egyptian treasuries. Hieroglyphics, statues, patterns. Most notably, Bastet, the goddess of protection, pleasure, and the bringer of good health.  She had the head of a black feline, and a female body. She was the daughter of Ra, the sun god, and it was believed that at night she would turn into a cat to protect Ra from his greatest enemy, the serpent Apep.

        <h2>IRELAND & SCOTTISH FOLKLORE</h2>
        <p>The association of black cats and witchcraft in many folklores and methodologies. In Celtic methodology, specifically in irish and Scottish folklore, a Cat SÃ¬th (pronounced cot-SHEE), the size of a dog, with a white spot on its chest. Some other folklore stories say a Cat Sith is a witch in disguise. They say the witch can transform into a black cat, but only nine times. And after nine times, the witch remains a cat forever. It is presumed this is the behind story of the myth that cats have nine lives. It could also be partly a reason we associate black cats with witches, and why they are associated with Halloween.
